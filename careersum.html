		<h2>Career Summary and Goals</h2>
		<p>
			As a current college student pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering at Florida Polytechnic University, I am seeking to work alongside professionals in an internship and further develop the skills needed for my future career in this field. I have a passion for developing and improving renewable energy sources, and hopefully someday help to contribute to a more environmentally conscious society.
			<br>
			<br>
			I have experience working in a team environment from a part-time summer job at Culverâ€™s, as well as from working in physics and chemistry labs as part of school projects. In my free time, I enjoy volunteering at my local animal shelter where I take on responsibilities such as cleaning, customer service, and tending to the animals. To gain knowledge about electrical engineering concepts and principles aside from the coursework I do in school, I am an active member of several campus clubs focused on educating and building connections in the industry, one example being the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). I also have internship experience from working for Chastain-Skillman in the land surveying department, where I learned to use CAD software to make drawings of plats for large scale civil engineering projects and analyze information from field work to find errors in data collection.
			<br>
			<br>
			I am hoping an internship with an electrical engineering company will give me the experience and knowledge I need to start building my career dedicated to providing sustainable alternatives to non-renewable energy sources.
